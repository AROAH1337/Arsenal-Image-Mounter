----------------------
Graphical applications
----------------------

ArsenalImageMounter.exe has been moved to ArsenalRecon.com web site.
https://arsenalrecon.com/weapons/image-mounter/

One-piece (with the exception of some third-party libraries for supporting
forensics image file formats) powerful tool for mounting disk image files as
virtual drives. Supports raw disk images and various virtual machine image
formats through integrated DiscUtils library. Also supports certain forensics
image formats if libewf.dll, libaff4.dll and libqcow.dll are also installed.
Automatically installs necessary driver components if not already installed.

ArsenalImageMounter.exe requires .NET 6.0, which can be installed on Windows 7
and later.
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

Tested on Windows 10 and 11, but should also work on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.


-------------------------
Command line applications
-------------------------

aim_cli.exe:
Command line tool for mounting various disk image formats as virtual drives in
a way similar to the graphical ArsenalImageMounter.exe.

Does not include driver setup files. Driver could be set up separately using
either command line tool aim_ll.exe or graphical ArsenalImageMounter.exe, or
the separate packages in the DriverSetup directory.

aim_cli.exe comes in two different versions.

-- Command line applications\aim_cli.exe

This version requires .NET Framework 4.8, which is included by default in
latest versions of Windows 10, 11 and Server 2022 and can be installed
separately on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 and later.

.NET Framework 4.8 is available here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48

-- Command line applications\DotNetCore\aim_cli.exe

Recommended for best performance.

This version requires .NET 6.0 which can be installed on Windows 7 and later
and Server 2008 R2 and later as well as Linux and MacOS.

.NET 6.0 is available here:
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0

Tested on Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11 and Linux. When running on other platforms
than Windows, available features are limited to what does not require kernel
level drivers. For example image file format conversion is available in this
scenario, but not mounting images as virtual disks.


aim_ll.zip:
Command line tools that provide access to most features of virtual SCSI
miniport driver that is used with Arsenal Image Mounter. Command line syntax
is very similar to that of ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver, so most commands and
scripting work in a similar way. There are also command line switches for
installing or uninstalling the virtual SCSI miniport driver.

None of the files in this zip archive require any .NET Framework components.

Tested on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, but should also work on any Windows version
from Windows 2000 and up.


-----------
DriverSetup
-----------

Setup tools and signed driver packages that can be used to install the driver
components alone.


ArsenalImageMounterGUISetup.exe:
One-piece simple driver setup GUI application that includes everything to
