Description of directory structure for Arsenal Image Mounter repository.

libewf.dll and zlib.dll binaries (to facilitate EnCase/EWF image mounting) are
included under their respective licenses - see lgpl-3.0.txt and
zlib license.txt.



----------------------
Graphical applications
----------------------

ArsenalImageMounter.exe has been moved to ArsenalRecon.com web site.
https://arsenalrecon.com/weapons/image-mounter/

One-piece (with the exception of some third-party libraries for supporting
forensics image file formats) powerful tool for mounting disk image files as
virtual drives. Supports raw disk images and various virtual machine image
formats through integrated DiscUtils library. Also supports certain forensics
image formats if libewf.dll is also installed. Automatically installs
necessary driver components if not already installed.

ArsenalImageMounter.exe requires .NET Framework 4.8, which is included by
default in latest versions of Windows 10, 11 and Server 2022 and can be
installed separately on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 and later.

Tested on Windows 10, but should also work on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.


-------------------------
Command line applications
-------------------------

aim_cli.exe:
Command line tool for mounting various disk image formats as virtual drives in
a way similar to the graphical ArsenalImageMounter.exe.

Does not include driver setup files. Driver could be set up separately using
either command line tool aim_ll.exe or graphical ArsenalImageMounter.exe, or
the separate packages in the DriverSetup directory.

aim_cli.exe requires .NET Framework 4.5, which is included by
default in Windows 8 or later. Can be installed separately on Windows Vista
and 7.

Tested on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, but should also work on Windows XP or Vista.


aim_ll.zip:
Command line tools that provide access to most features of virtual SCSI
miniport driver that is used with Arsenal Image Mounter. Command line syntax
is very similar to that of ImDisk Virtual Disk Driver, so most commands and
scripting work in a similar way. There are also command line switches for
installing or uninstalling the virtual SCSI miniport driver.

None of the files in this zip archive require any .NET Framework components.

Tested on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, but should also work on any Windows version
from Windows 2000 and up.


------------------------------------
Command line applications\DotNetCore
------------------------------------

"Modern .NET" version of aim_cli. Requires .NET 6 or later.

Same features as with the .NET Framework 4.5 version above, but typically
with better performance. When running on other platforms than Windows,
available features are limited to what does not require kernel level drivers.
For example image file format conversion is available in this scenario, but
not mounting images as virtual disks.


-----------
DriverSetup
-----------

Setup tools and signed driver packages that can be used to install the driver
components alone.


ArsenalImageMounterGUISetup.exe:
One-piece simple driver setup GUI application that includes everything to
automatically install the correct driver for current version of Windows.

ArsenalImageMounterCLISetup.exe:
Command line version of ArsenalImageMounterGUISetup.exe, with same
functionality and requirements.


Both ArsenalImageMounterGUISetup.exe and ArsenalImageMounterCLISetup.exe
require .NET Framework 4.x or later, which is included by default in Windows
8 or later. Can be installed separately on Windows XP, Vista or 7.


DriverSetup.7z:
Both driver setup files and command line tool aim_ll.exe as a 7-zip archive.
Useful for automated driver setup, for example for use from a script.

Application files in this archive do not require any .NET components.


DriverSetup.zip:
Driver setup files only (sys, cat and inf files). For use when integrating
driver setup with, for example, other driver setup packages.


---
API
---

Arsenal.ImageMounter.zip:
DLL files that can be referenced from .NET applications to use the public API.

API reference is available online:
http://ltr-data.se/library/ArsenalImageMounter

Requires .NET Framework 4.x or later, which is included by default in Windows
8 or later. Can be installed separately on Windows XP, Vista or 7.

It is also possible to build API components for .NET 6 or later "modern .NET"
runtimes.


aimapi.zip:
DLL files that can be used from other applications to use most features of
virtual SCSI miniport driver. Files in this archive do not require any .NET
Framework components and should work on any Windows version from 2000 and up.

There are .lib and .h files included which can be imported into C/C++ projects
to use the API.

----------------

Visual Studio 2017-2019 solution with source projects for native (non-.NET)
driver, API library and command line tool. Driver project requires WDK 8.1 or
later.

The driver project directory also contains files for building with WDK 7
build.exe environment, to support targeting older Windows versions than
Windows 7.
